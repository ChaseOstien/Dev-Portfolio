# My Developer Portfolio

## Description

The goal of this project was to practice HTML and CSS subjects including semantics, stucture, flexbox, CSS selectors, CSS variables and many more. We achieved this through the designing of a personal portfolio page that includes an about me, links to our live projects and contact information. This page is hosted live on GitHub under the repository "https://github.com/ChaseOstien/Dev-Portfolio".
